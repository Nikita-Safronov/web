  <h2>Algebra</h2><!--Category 1-->
    <p>Algebra is an extremely interesting class. In this class, 
      students learn what variables are and how to give a value and find the value of those variables. <!--Algebra paragraph-->
      Students also learn about equations and how to graph them on the coordinate plane.</p>

  <h2>Geometry</h2><!--Category 2-->
    <p>Geometry is what students take after finishing Algebra 1. 
      Students start learning about shapes and their angles. <!--Geometry paragraph-->
      Students also begin to do proofs with all the postulates 
      and theroems they learn about shapes and angles.</p>

  <h2>Trigonometry</h2><!--Category 3-->
    <p>Trigonometry is basically the combination of Algebra and Geometry. 
      Students start using angles in equations. <!--Trigonometry Paragraph-->
      Students also begin to learn about Sin, Cos, and Tan and all their interesting properties.</p>
